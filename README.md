Ryan Lewien's Personal Website

-----------Version History------------

Verion 1.3: Large overhaul of title page, now incorporating the "About Me" section. Added loading sequence.

Version 1.2: Included recent projects scaled properly for desktop and mobile, still requires a visual overhaul of the title spread and offloading images to AWS or other cloud service for faster loading.

Version 1.1: Fixed up links and small elements, so the site is functional and presentable.

Version 1.0: Currently does not have recent projects on it, but a basic framework is there! Very excited about this page and where it'll go over time.
